sharing the data from component to another component
-----------------------------------------with @Input-------------------------------------------
we initialize the variable obviously and sharing the data via a parent component html files
and in that file we call the selector: 'app-post' like 
<app-post></app-post>
and then we will give any key but to the value to the key has to be variable which has initialized
or varible which holds the data u want to share the from parent component to child component
"announcement"   announcement:string = 'Hello again Angular!'; 
[parentData]="announcement"
<app-post [parentData]="announcement"></app-post>
then calling in with the name parentData as 
@Input({ alias: 'parentData' }) parentannouncement: string =''
or
@Input() parentData: string =''


sharing data from child component to parent component via 2 methods
1. @ViewChild
2. @Output and Event Emitter

sharing data from one component to another component if there is no parent child relationship
then we use dependency injection



for loop
<li *ngFor="let Todo of TodoList; index as i">
        {{i+1}}
        {{ Todo.TodoName }}
      </li>
if 
<span *ngIf="isFirst">default</span>
